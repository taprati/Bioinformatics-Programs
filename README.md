# Bioinformatics Programs
## Here are a few of the programs I have made for biology courses

### Feature Finders:
This folder contains a tool to search through gff files with given perameters. One version is written in Python and the other is written in R. The test_params.txt file shows an example usage of each. 

### Tajima-Test:
Here is a program I made in a population genetics course to calculate the Tajima D statistic. The program takes in sequences in FASTA format, and returns the Tajima D statistic.
